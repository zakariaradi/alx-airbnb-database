# Query Optimization Report

## Initial Query Analysis
The initial query joins four tables (bookings, users, properties, payments) without proper indexing, which can lead to:
- Full table scans on large datasets
- Slow JOIN operations
- High memory usage for sorting

## Performance Issues Identified
1. Missing indexes on foreign key columns
2. No pagination for large result sets
3. Retrieving all historical data when recent data might suffice
4. No query caching strategy

## Optimization Strategies Applied

### 1. Index Creation
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_user_id ON bookings(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_property_id ON bookings(property_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_payments_booking_id ON payments(booking_id);
